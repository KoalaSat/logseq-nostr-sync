## NostrSync

Thank you for contributing! Please take a moment to review our [**contributing guidelines**](https://github.com/KoalaSat/logseq-nostr-sync/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to make the process easy and effective for everyone involved.

**Please open an issue** before embarking on any significant pull request, especially those that
add a new library or change existing tests, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working
on something that might not end up being merged into the project.

Before opening a pull request, please ensure:

- [ ] Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) and initialize it: `pip install pre-commit`, then `pre-commit install`. Pre-commit installs git hooks that automatically check the codebase. If pre-commit fails when you commit your changes, please fix the problems it points out.

Be kind to code reviewers, please try to keep pull requests as small and focused as possible :)

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/KoalaSat/logseq-nostr-sync/blob/main/LICENSE).
